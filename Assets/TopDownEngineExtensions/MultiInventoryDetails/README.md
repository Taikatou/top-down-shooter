# MultiInventoryDetails
MoreMountains Inventory Engine Add-on to handle all active inventories on scene.
You can use it as default InventoryDetails, switch to multi inventory to handle all active inventories on scene and disable only few of them. Feel free to modify it to your needs.

### Add-on setup guide:
1. Clone or download ItemDetails.cs to your project
2. Create Inventory Details object on your canvas the same way as from [that page](http://inventory-engine-docs.moremountains.com/item-details.html) except don't use InventoryDetails.cs and use ItemDetails.cs instead

### I will not add special features to this only fix bugs if you find something. Happy using :)
